                    <h5>WRITTEN BY: JASON A. RAMO</h5>

                    <p>Let's start by explaining Geocaching. In May 2000, the restrictions on the satelite Global Positioning System ("GPS") were lifted and allowed for smaller caches to be hidden due to the increased accuracy. Geocaching is an outdoor recreational activity in which people from all over the world both hide and find containers called "geocaches". These "caches" can range in size from about the size of an pencil eraser or as large as a dumpster or even a self-storage unit. These often waterproof containers are placed in interesting (or sometimes mundane) locations and their precise coordinates are uploaded for others to find.</p>
                    
                    <p>Now how do you find these caches? The easiest method (my preferred) is using the official geocache app on my smartphone. This is a great option as you have the GPS, data to immediately upload your find with notes, and you can search for your next cache right on the device. The fun part is that it isn't all digital. You will also need to have a pen or pencil. The container you find will have a physical log you will need to sign with your community established tag proving you truly found the cache.</p>

                    </div>
                    
                    <p>Sometimes you don't find your targeted cache. Unfortunately this happens from time to time. I suppose the geocache community is filled with Harry Potter fans because they call people who aren't versed in caching - muggles. If a muggle tampers, destroys, or removes from the proper coordinates, then the cache is said to have been muggled. Infrequently, a fellow cacher simply doesn't place the container back where it was found. In the instance you don't find the cache, it is etiquette to notify the person who hid the cache by marking a Did Not Find (DNF) and leaving a note.  Don't let a DNF get you down.  Just move on to the next.</p>

                    <p>When you finally do find your targeted cache, you will be rewarded with an ejoyable rush of excitement. Now, depending on container size, you get to add your name to the log, look at any trinkets others have left behind, and log and take any trackables for movement to another cache location. At a bare minimum, every cache will have a log. When you are finished signing the log (and reviewing the contents of the cache), you will need to put it all back in the container. Then put the container back into the same exact spot for the next person to find. The only thing left to do is update your smartphone app and leave some kind words for the cache owner.

                    <p>I have yet to secure a geocache outside of the United States, however the wife and I have a trip to Helsing&#248r, Denmark around the holidays. I cannot wait to be immersed in Danish culture but am glad I have a familiar activity to put me at ease. This adventure will be documented and placed onto my global tab at the top of the page.</p>
